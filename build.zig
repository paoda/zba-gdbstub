    // that it cannot hook into private compiler APIs. All compilation work
    // orchestrated by the build system will result in other Zig compiler
    // subcommands being invoked with the right flags defined. You can observe
    // these invocations when one fails (or you pass a flag to increase
    // verbosity) to validate assumptions and diagnose problems.
    //
    // Lastly, the Zig build system is relatively simple and self-contained,
    // and reading its source code will allow you to master it.
